The GitHub folder https://github.com/tshkfrkw/psychotherapytrialcontrols contains the following R files.
MASTER.R: installs the necessary packages and obtains descriptive statistics
response.R: runs NMA for the primary outcome ÅgresponseÅh
continuous.R: runs NMA for the secondary outcome Ågdepression severityÅh
broad CBT.R: treats all active nodes as one node
bayesian.R: runs meta-regression

However, the data files are not uploaded so that you cannot run the commands themselves. We have uploaded the R files so that you can examine the codes we used.
